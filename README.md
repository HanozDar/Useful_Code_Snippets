## Useful_Code_Snippets
Useful snippets of code that I wrote that could help me in competitions, CTFs and otherwise
It can include small stuff in pwntools, or just random things I notice I use a lot while trying to solve various challenges
Its honestly really basic stuff, but I thought it's useful to have a repository where I can just store at one location so I can keep referencing it
Feel free to use it or make any suggestions!
